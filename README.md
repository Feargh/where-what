## where-what

An app to store recommendations that can be used to give friends travelling to
various cities tips on where to eat. It is to initally include food
recommendations for one city with scope to expand after this.

I created the frontend using react, vite, bootstrap and openleaf maps. I
seperated the code into components and pages.

## Technologies used:

- database with Entity Framework Core and Sqlite

### Repo Organisation on Github
